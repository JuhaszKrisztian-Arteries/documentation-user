=====================
Upsell a subscription
=====================

Subscriptions are recurrent and go on indefinitely. As time passes by, our customers may want to
modify them. We must then be able to adapt the prices or change the productsâ€™ quantities to
accommodate their needs. Two situations can happen:

1. **Loyal customers:** This kind of customers already trust you as a brand. Therefore, you are
   confident regarding what you offer since they keep paying for your products and services.
   Consequently, it is easier to sell them something additional than it would be to a
   new customer.

2. **New customers:** For this kind of customers, you have to come with something new, something
   attractive. What about discounts? Typically, every subscriptions end after a certain given time.
   Making these types of offers for new customers strengthens your relationships with them and also
   increases their retention. In other words, upselling can make a subscription last longer.
